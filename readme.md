## About Board game score tracker
The idea is to create a score tracker for board games. You will be able to create an account with one of 3 socialite account: google, Facebook or Hotmail. I have chosen to keep the authentication outside of the program. Creating & logging in through socialite accounts is more secure. This way there wont be any passphrases in the database. From the socialite accounts we will get the first name, last name & e-mail account. 

All authenticated users will be able to create groups, the admin of the group will be able to add games, users & links. If a user is known in the database he can approve himself to see the group info. 

All members of a group will be able to add game scores and update them. The admin can always correct the scores. 

## Future plans
if the score tracker is up and running we might dream about future plans. The list will probably grow
  -	 Game detailed scores: if you play games like 7 wonders you will notices the score fiche will exist out of several  lines(points for blue cards, points for wonders, ?) . It should be a nice feature to have this present.
  -	Turn order drawer: Our group usually draws who is first, second and so on. 
  -	Game drawer:  sometimes we are undecided on which game to play, so a program that could do it for us would be welcome
